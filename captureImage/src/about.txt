    mediaDevices refers to an array of media device objects that represent available input and output devices on the user's system. These devices include:

    Microphones ("audioinput")
    Speakers / Headphones ("audiooutput")
    Cameras / Webcams ("videoinput")
    This array comes from the navigator.mediaDevices.enumerateDevices() API, which lists all connected media devices (such as webcams and microphones).

    In the code:

    js
    Copy
    Edit
    setDevices(mediaDevices.filter(({ kind }) => kind === "videoinput"))
    mediaDevices contains all available media devices.
    .filter(({ kind }) => kind === "videoinput") extracts only the devices that are cameras/webcams (kind === "videoinput").
    setDevices(...) updates the state with only the video input devices.

    NOTE : the mediadevices  in the handleDevices is the list of mediaDevies available which is passed from useEffect using enumerateDevices
    When the web app loads, useEffect runs automatically.
    It asks the browser for a list of all connected media devices (like cameras and microphones) using:

    navigator.mediaDevices.enumerateDevices()
    Once the browser provides the list, .then(handleDevices) runs, passing that list to handleDevices.
    handleDevices filters out only cameras (kind === "videoinput") and updates the devices state.
    Now, devices contains only webcams or cameras connected to the system.
